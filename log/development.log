About half of India\\u0026#8217;s coal reserves—the fifth largest in the world—that is available above 600 meters is low-quality coal, former Coal India chairman S. Narsing Rao \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/should-coal-be-denationalised-112082900014_1.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Epointed out\\u003C/a\\u003E in 2012. \\u0026#8220;If the private sector, including multinational corporations, is allowed to mine coal for commercial purposes, it will probably stick to producing from areas that have a low cost of production and high quality of coal,\\u0026#8221; he argued.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Jaitley wants to safeguard Coal India, it can\\u0026#8217;t exactly allow private firms into these lucrative coal assets and ask the state-run miner to look elsewhere.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EQuality matters\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMuch of India\\u0026#8217;s unexploited coal reserves lie in remote areas with inadequate transportation infrastructure. If private firms are asked to look at these assets, they will be forced to build expensive infrastructure to extract coal from these mines. This new transport infrastructure will then have to be linked with existing railway routes—that already moves about half of India\\u0026#8217;s coal—for further movement. Coordination between Coal India and the railways is already problematic, so adding private miners in the mix won\\u0026#8217;t make things any better.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMoreover, with Coal India selling coal at a subsidized price, it\\u0026#8217;s unclear how private firms will recover these large investments since pricing their coal according to international benchmarks will drive up cost for customers—primarily power, steel and cement sectors—who will then want to pass on the cost to the end-consumer. Industry is unlikely to react happily. And if the government forces miners to keep their prices low, private players can\\u0026#8217;t be expected to queue up.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn short, opening up the sector to private miners while fully safeguarding Coal India\\u0026#8217;s interests, is going to be a tightrope walk.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;In the current situation, it\\u0026#8217;s not right to get merchant miners into the sector,\\u0026#8221; an analyst told Quartz, requesting anonymity since the details of the policy aren\\u0026#8217;t public yet, \\u0026#8220;Till Coal India\\u0026#8217;s share (of the market) goes down, it is not possible in the next few years.\\u0026#8221; And reducing dependence of Coal India would primarily happen through an increase in captive mining.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat may be exactly what finance minister Jaitley intends on doing by streamlining the coal auction process—and by refusing to give a clear timeline on allowing private players.

Stray dogs lazed under military vehicles and bored soldiers hung around, nervously playing with their automatic weapons.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe surroundings were at odds with a man who preached peace and non-violence, but there he was as he is in several countries—bald, round spectacles sitting on his nose, looking at a world where his teachings are still relevant and another that has left him behind.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat was Gandhi doing there, I wondered aloud.

He is the most famous brand India has produced. The boost to the country’s soft power through his statues and busts that dot public spaces across continents is not only huge, but also enduring. He has now lived in the hearts and mind of billions for nearly 80 years since his assassination. And by the looks of it, he isn’t fading away soon.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe “half-naked fakir”, as Winston Churchill famously called him, is a face probably better recognized than those of most Bollywood actors. In fact, probably better known than that of Churchill, the man who hated the Mahatma and whose rivalry brought the British Empire down.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGandhi, like Churchill, died a broken man. Politically irrelevant after he guided India to independence, Gandhi’s legacy at home has been constantly debated. However, his contribution to India’s global image is unparalleled.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs British India broke into two and millions of people perished in pre- and post-partition violence, Gandhi, shunned by his disciples, virtually retired, bitterly complaining that nobody listened to him anymore. His murder, by a religious fanatic, however, changed the course of events. In his death he achieved what he couldn’t when he lived—bring a turbulent nation together and stop the gory dance of violence that had enveloped the infant republic.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis martyrdom eventually put him on history’s high pedestal and made him acceptable globally as an apostle of peace, ensuring his brand of politics remained relevant. In India, politicians, convulsing against his political thought, consigned him to school text books—bringing him alive on his death and birth anniversaries for formal ceremonies that involved the twice annual ritual of cleaning bird droppings from his statues and naming public schemes after him.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EA different path\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFrank Moraes, the editor of \\u003Cem\\u003EThe Times of India\\u003C/em\\u003E, recounted a conversation with HSL Polak—one of Gandhi’s close associates in South Africa—in an article he wrote for the \\u003Cem\\u003EForeign Affairs\\u003C/em\\u003E journal to mark the Mahatma’s 10\\u003Csup\\u003Eth\\u003C/sup\\u003E death anniversary in 1958. He asked Polak how much of Gandhi’s teaching he thought survived in India. “Ostensibly a great deal… In reality, very little,” said Polak.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, neither India nor the Congress Party ever accepted Gandhi’s doctrine of non-violence as creed. “The Congress Party, including Nehru and other prominent leaders such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, accepted non-violence but only as a method. With them it was an instrument of political practice, not an article of faith,” wrote Moraes.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the 56 years since his article, the situation has only worsened. Very little of the Mahatma\\u0026#8217;s politics has survived in India; we could, however, despite our reluctance, take pride in our ability to export an enduring brand. It is perhaps more relevant to the world than to India, mostly because we have chosen to take a path different from his.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat probably was a good reason why Richard Attenborough’s film on the man many Britons hated won the Oscar for best film. That probably was also the reason for the U.S. Congress to pass a special legislation allowing the Mahatma’s statute in Washington to be installed on government land.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile we, as a nation, use him on occasions of political exigencies, the world only wants more of Gandhi for his political thought.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EMyriad Mahatmas\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIndeed, the metallic Mahatma is much in demand. Under a well-structured programme run jointly by India’s overseas missions, which work out the modalities of the placement of statues and busts, and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) that pays the sculptors who make the statutes, replicas of the bespectacled apostle of peace are regularly shipped to the world.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBetween 2001 and 2010, nearly 70 busts and statues of the Mahatma were sent to dozens of countries by the ICCR. That’s an average of seven a year. The bust I saw in Djibouti was sent in 2003 for installation on a street named after the Mahatma. The cigar chewing Mr. Churchill, who never regretted his long-time rival’s death, hasn’t had it so good!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mahatma’s statue is due to be unveiled at the Parliament Square in London next year alongside those of Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela—the man who was so influenced by Gandhi as he led his people to an apartheid-free South Africa. Churchill’s statue is one of the 10 already erected at this place.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EOwning Gandhi\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHere, at home, he still has an occasional use. The stamp of moral authority that he has left on this nation means the Mahatma—though a Congress man—can be greedily adopted by other political parties when required. Modi’s effort to make him the face of his “Clean India” campaign is just another example of Gandhi’s use for political convenience.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDespite promising to build a towering statue of Patel in the run up to the general elections that swept him to power, Modi now wants his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to own “Brand Gandhi” and take over the events that mark the death and birth anniversaries of the Mahatma. Up until now, these ceremonies were the responsibility of a special committee constituted by an Act of parliament.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe Mahatma’s adoption by the BJP—the political face of an organization whose members celebrated the Mahatma’s death—is ironic, but then that’s the strength of a brand that has endured the rough and tumble of time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"edition-credit india\\\"\\u003EThis article is a part of Quartz India.

Taxes didn’t go up despite our decade-long engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. The resulting disconnect between the military and the civilian population has been cited as a source of concern by General Stan McChrystal, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and many others. MSNBC host Chris Hayes points out that the proportion of congressmen who had served in the military is now lower than for the population at large, while the reverse had been true up to 1995; we also have shown a greater propensity to project military force since around the same time.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI don’t recall a single person from my time at either Exeter or Brown who went into the armed forces. One woman the year below me at Columbia Law School joined the JAG Corps afterwards—I remember this in part because she was so unusual. For people who graduated from Brown or similar institutions, the notion of \\u0026#8220;service\\u0026#8221; tends to take less the form of \\u0026#8220;join the army\\u0026#8221; and more \\u0026#8220;go help some people.\\u0026#8221; Although Harvard, Yale, and Columbia have recently reinstated ROTC, there are more prevalent non-military service options for students, including Teach for America, the Peace Corps, City Year, and similar programs and organizations. The message is that service means working with children, teaching the poor, working at a non-profit and that sort of activity.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’ll confess that I never realistically considered any of these options when I graduated from college in the mid-90s. I went directly to law school and became a corporate attorney. I did a few things such that I still felt somewhat pro-social (e.g., I took on a pro bono asylum case for an indigent woman, volunteered for friends’ organizations when asked), but these activities were peripheral to the basic cause of succeeding professionally.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI’m far from unique. There are a ton of young people whose goal it is to get a good job at a good firm, pay some bills, get a date, get an apartment, buy some furniture, etc. and maybe volunteer on the side. These impulses are healthy and positive. Teddy Roosevelt remarked that a man’s first duty is to provide for himself and his family; only after this has been done can he be of service to the general public. Today, with women experiencing higher educational attainment than men, I’m sure the same could be applied across gender lines.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAfter arriving at the law firm though, I found practicing corporate law to be a poor fit. It wasn’t because I wasn’t helping people or doing something noble. The problem for me was that my work felt fungible and pointless. I wasn’t creating any value. My reviewing documents was a transaction cost. Someone else could step in and take my place and the world would be exactly the same.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI left to co-found a startup, Stargiving.com, that used the internet to help celebrities raise money more effectively for their favorite non-profits using sponsored clicks (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://freerice.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ethink freerice.com\\u003C/a\\u003E but with celebrities offering to meet people who clicked on their cause). The company didn’t work out, I’m sure in part because I had little idea what I was doing. I went from there to a mobile software company and a health care software company, eventually becoming the CEO of Manhattan GMAT, a test prep company that was acquired by the Washington Post.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI could say that these roles were about helping people (raising money for charities, making hospitals more efficient, helping young people achieve their goals, etc.) but that wasn’t why I did any of them. The important factor was that I thought I was making a difference for the organization each day. I just wanted to feel that my work mattered, and that I was developing in a direction I wanted to go. It was less about the activity itself and more about what I was accomplishing.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt least for me, the metrics were less about \\u0026#8220;am I helping people?”—it was more, was I creating value? Am I having an impact? Did I value the people around me? Was I becoming a better person or professional over time? If I stopped showing up, would it matter? I founded Venture for America in large part to drive our talented young people to environments where they could answer these questions in a positive way. Venture for America channels enterprising graduates to early-stage companies in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans, St. Louis and other US cities to promote job growth and train the next generation of entrepreneurs. Our goal is to help create 100,000 new US jobs by 2025.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPeople who enlist for military service or devote their lives to the unfortunate are clearly worthy of praise and admiration. At the same time, military service isn’t a realistic option for many, and I’ve seen tons of idealistic young people go work for large non-profits and organizations only to become frustrated with their roles or burnt out. In my view, if we broaden the notion of service to include \\u0026#8220;helping organizations succeed,\\u0026#8221; \\u0026#8220;creating value,\\u0026#8221; and \\u0026#8220;generating new opportunities for yourself and others,\\u0026#8221; we’ll give many young people license to take on pursuits that are more sustainable for them and will drive society forward.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EJob creation and paths to the middle class are today what our economy and society need most. If you examine our communities, what we need as much as anything else are new companies that help enliven neighborhoods and give people meaningful avenues for personal advancement. Nothing conveys a sense of self-worth like the right opportunity. This is the new call to service—“Can you create 5, or 50, or 500 jobs for people in Detroit, New Orleans, Providence, or Baltimore?” Success will drive our ability to educate our children and many other things.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt’s time we posed a different vision of service to our young people that addresses the needs of today. Business formation and economic dynamism are at record lows. We need new businesses to drive job creation and new opportunities. If our young people decide to take on the challenge of revitalizing our country’s economy, they’ll grow to become precisely the kind of people and builders we need them to be.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe challenge that lies ahead is to make the path to entrepreneurship as well-lit and supported as other more conventional paths. Imagine if we gave each aspiring entrepreneur the same level of support and resources that currently go to aspiring lawyers and doctors, both of which often receive $100,000+ apiece in federally subsidized education loans and praise from all around them. In my experience, entrepreneurship is a lonely endeavor. We can make it less so and make it possible to serve both oneself and society.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EYou can follow Andrew on Twitter at \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/AndrewYangVFA\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E@AndrewYangVFA\\u003C/a\\u003E.

So to make these determinations, it relied solely on the data it collected in the previous year from billions of search results displayed on its website. This means that the buy-two-weeks-in-advance figure it gave us this year was actually the best time to buy last year. It also means that when Kayak said that the best time to buy in 2012 was 12 weeks out, they were off by 10 weeks.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn average, a flyer who followed Kayak\\u0026#8217;s advice last year would have paid 4.6% more for the fare than if they were able to buy at the time of lowest fares.

St. Louis is a region on edge, united only in anticipation that the worst is still to come.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003ESocial media and segregation\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn Oct. 10-13, St. Louis hosted a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.fergusonoctober.com\\\"\\u003E“Weekend of Resistance,”\\u003C/a\\u003E during which thousands of activists descended upon the city in support of Michael Brown and his family. That same weekend in St. Charles, supporters of Darren Wilson held a bowling night to support Wilson’s defense fund. They announced the event on a Darren Wilson Facebook support group with over 80,000 members. It is one of many Wilson support groups with membership in the tens of thousands.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESocial media is one of the few spaces in St. Louis not subject to segregation.

The protesters are called “terrorists,” sometimes “treasonous terrorists.” Groups of black protesters are described as a “lynch mob” targeting whites. Looting, which has been rare during the months of protest, is emphasized. The characterization of the protesters by Wilson supporters reflects both whites’ rationale for fleeing St. Louis and Wilson’s for killing Michael Brown: fear of black crime.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-284387\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  alignleft zoomable size-small\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"284387\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F284383%2Fi-am-darren-wilson-st-louis-and-the-geography-of-fear%2Fi%2F284387%2F\\u0026text=%26%238220%3BI+am+Darren+Wilson%26%238221%3B%3A+St.+Louis+and+the+geography+of+fear\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F284383%2Fi-am-darren-wilson-st-louis-and-the-geography-of-fear%2Fi%2F284387%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/darren.png?w=450\\\" data-retina=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/darren.png?w=450\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Graphic found on a “Support Darren Wilson” Facebook page\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003EGraphic found on a “Support Darren Wilson” Facebook page\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne Wilson supporter, a lifelong North County resident who is white and asked to remain anonymous, explained his perspective in an email:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Demanding Wilson’s arrest before that process is completed is akin to a lynch mob and would circumvent our sacred process of actual justice.

Many of the residents of St. Charles County—where Wilson claims his base of support—grew up in St. Louis’s North County, the series of suburbs north of the city, which includes Ferguson. Once a white, blue-collar hub, North County underwent a dramatic demographic shift in the 1980s and 1990s as black St. Louis families fled the decay of the inner city.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs St. Louis County became more black and saw its population stagnate, the white population of St. Charles County \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Charles_County,_Missouri\\\"\\u003Esurged\\u003C/a\\u003E, from 144,107 in 1980 to 360,485 in 2013.

Tiffany believes the media “refuse to show the videos of the protesters/domestic terrorists pointing guns at police officers and threatening them.” (No such videos are known to exist.)

Ferguson protesters’ central complaint is that rule of law is selectively applied and ruthlessly abused.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFaith in law enforcement has migrated to St. Charles County along with the people it protects.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnsurprisingly, law enforcement officials are among the most loyal Wilson supporters. As with other supporters, there is a wide range in their rationales. Many echo the sentiment of the Wilson fan pages, that framing this as a race issue is itself racist. One officer who grew up in St. Louis County but now lives in St. Charles County, and asked to remain anonymous says: “Police officers have a very difficult time no matter what city.  This case would never be an issue if Darren Wilson were a black male. The African-Americans in Ferguson \\u003Cem\\u003Echose\\u003C/em\\u003E to make this a racial issue.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut Mark Whitson, a former police officer recently retired from 35 years in the St. Louis County Police Department, believes officer education on racial politics is itself a problem. He recalls a class he taught on law enforcement: “I pointed out the socio-historical environment where all contacts with the public take place. A major on the department pointed out the advancements and changes that have occurred since slavery ended, through the 1950s and \\u0026#8217;60s. I agreed with him, but believe that is no reason to stop.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen asked whether Wilson should be indicted, this officer replied he should not be and will not be. Legal analysts share the view that a non-indictment is likely, particularly given that the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-prosecutor-has-faced-controversy-for-decades/article_cdd4c104-6086-506e-9ee8-aa957a31fee5.html\\\"\\u003Eprosecutor\\u003C/a\\u003E, Bob McCulloch, failed to bring about an indictment in prior officer-involved shootings.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003ERegion on the run\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEvery Tuesday night since Sept. 23, dozens of protesters, nearly all black, have shared their concerns with the St. Louis County Council, most of whom are white.

It’s the worst outbreak since the disease was discovered almost 40 years ago. Liberia is the country that\\u0026#8217;s been hit the hardest. More than 2,300 Liberians have died. The nascent economy of the post-civil-war country is down, but Ebola causes more than death and economic stagnation. The highly infectious disease has built invisible barriers between people—human contact is strictly forbidden and deep mistrust rules the streets of Liberia.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBecause of an 11pm curfew, Monrovia’s nightclubs open earlier than they used to. At Exodus bar around 6pm on a saturday night, you can hear loud music playing while the sun was still shining. Inside the club, people quietly sat around tables and no one danced. A partygoer said he wears long sleeves to avoid getting sick. Frequently, the deejay lowered the volume of the dancehall music to remind people of the risks through his microphone: “Well, Ebola is real. It’s here in Liberia.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“As soon as it’s 6:30, 7 o’clock, we lower the music because we understand that when the music is high it gives people the momentum to wake up to dance,“said Steve Wiefueh, the club\\u0026#8217;s accountant. “Then we think, when they’re not hearing the heavy beat, they’ll just sit there, drink their beer and go home.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENevertheless, some Monrovians kept coming. Viviane Gambah, a heavy woman in her thirties wearing a gold necklace that disappeared in the depth of her cleavage, sat outside on a terrace next to the club and downed some beers with her girlfriends.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Today I just left my house because sometimes when we sit and think on this Ebola issue, we feel bad,“ she said in the melodic up-and-down of Liberian English. “And sometimes we really don’t know what to do. I just decided to come out and drink two or three bottles and go and sleep. But really I don’t dance. I don’t go to the club and dance. I don’t really associate myself.“\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENo dancing, no flirting, no touching, no kissing.

For example, Google Doc settings should be private, so nobody outside the intended audience (students, teachers, maybe parents) can access documents such as homework and assignments, says Henry Thiele, the assistant superintendent for technology \\u0026amp; learning for Maine Township district 207 (which is located in Illinois). Additionally, classrooms using iPads, cloud-based programs or apps should have generic usernames and passwords so that the app can\\u0026#8217;t identify and profile a student individually. That way the app company wouldn\\u0026#8217;t know, for example, that a specific child answered a certain number of questions correctly, or how long the mouse hovered on a problem.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EWhat parents can do: \\u003C/strong\\u003EFirst of all, confer with your child and her teacher directly to make sure these basic protections are in place. Next, some good questions ask her teacher are “What’s the instructional information that you collect on my child?” and “How is it being used to help my child?\\u0026#8221; suggests Thomas Murray, a former school district administrator in Pennsylvania who is now at the DC-based education advocacy group the Alliance for Excellent Education\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe federal \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/0493-Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions#General%20Questions\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Cb\\u003E \\u003C/b\\u003Erequires parental permission to sign up a child under the age of 13 for an instructional/cloud-based appthat has a username/password.

If your child is older than 13 and you\\u0026#8217;re unhappy with the practices in the classroom, or if you notice these common sense measures aren\\u0026#8217;t being enforced, raise those concerns with the teacher or principal, suggests Murray.

Most of these states put the responsibility on the school district to prevent identifiable student data from being used for any purpose other than education, such as advertising.

The bids and contracts themselves are all public information and subject to public comment at school board meetings.

The impending expiration of the space shuttle program, which flew US astronauts and cargo into orbit from 1981 to 2011, prompted a scattered response in the US space agency. In 2005, the Bush administration launched the first successor program, Constellation, intended as a ticket to both the ISS and the moon.

At Marty\\u0026#8217;s insistence, NASA\\u0026#8217;s attorneys were able to exploit a loophole created by the slapdash nature of the agency\\u0026#8217;s original founding. In the panic after the Soviet Union got to space first with Sputnik, the White House had demanded a civil space agency fast, and to avoid missing any opportunities, a young attorney had added a kind of universal action clause\\u003Cstrong\\u003E \\u003C/strong\\u003E(section 203, sub-section a, part 5) to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://history.nasa.gov/spaceact.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ethe 1958 law\\u003C/a\\u003E that founded NASA. \\u0026#8220;You know how Sherwin-Williams [Company] paint covers the world?\\u0026#8221; NASA general counsel \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/C3PO/WholleyMC/WholleyMC_3-19-13.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EMichael Wholley said\\u003C/a\\u003E. \\u0026#8220;He basically said, \\u0026#8216;If I’ve forgotten something, use this.\\u0026#8217;”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd so in 2006 Griffin and his colleagues came up with a system to sort-of invest in two companies, SpaceX and Rocketplane Kistler, to develop space transit.

SpaceX, on the other hand, would eventually collect $396 million from NASA while contributing $454 million of outside capital, including an initial $100 million of Musk\\u0026#8217;s own money in 2006.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe company\\u0026#8217;s outside fundraising strategy was simple: Turning to Musk\\u0026#8217;s deep-pocketed friends in Silicon Valley, who were more willing than hard-pressed New York financiers to take a flyer on something new. There was also an attractive quirk of the satellite launch business: Customers pre-pay to build their rocket.

Rockets are mostly fuel—for SpaceX, $200,000 worth of kerosene and liquid oxygen—with an almost delicate metal skin, mostly aluminum. Musk once asked an investor to imagine his 64 meter (224 ft) rocket, shrunk down to the size of a Coca-Cola can: The walls of the tiny explosive would be many times thinner than the drink in your hand.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is easier and cheaper to use solid-fuel engines. That would typically make them the first choice of the company\\u0026#8217;s chief designer—also Musk—but for the fact they are harder to control once ignited. For safety\\u0026#8217;s sake, more complex liquid-fueled rockets are the standard for taking people to space. The engines are spidered with metal capillaries that use the vessel\\u0026#8217;s own chilled fuel as coolant to keep the 3-D printed nozzle from melting in the wash of its own exhaust. Human flight was always the standard to which Musk\\u0026#8217;s associates say he aspired; and so the Merlin was the first new liquid-fueled rocket engine to fly in the United States since the 1970s.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EFalcon, Merlin, Kestrel, and Dragon\\u0026#8230; SpaceX\\u0026#8217;s machines were made by people who read pulp fantasy novels as children.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERockets headed for space typically have two stages. The first stage provides the massive thrust to get into orbit; then it\\u0026#8217;s discarded, and the second stage glides the payload to its final destination. A satellite, encased in a custom-made carbon fiber fairing, or a Dragon space capsule full of cargo—someday, passengers—perches on top of the rocket at launch. SpaceX\\u0026#8217;s first rocket prototype, the Falcon 1, used one Merlin engine in its first stage.

There\\u0026#8217;s no sign in the capital that funding for space is set to increase, and while that may not appear good for SpaceX, it\\u0026#8217;s even worse for its pricier competitors.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-282410\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  alignleft zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"282410\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F281619%2Fwhat-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company%2Fi%2F282410%2F\\u0026text=What+it+took+for+Elon+Musk%26%238217%3Bs+SpaceX+to+disrupt+Boeing%2C+leapfrog+NASA%2C+and+become+a+serious+space+company\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F281619%2Fwhat-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company%2Fi%2F282410%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/dragon2_interior.jpg?w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/dragon2_interior.jpg?w=640\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"The touchscreen controls in the cockpit of the future.\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003EThe touchscreen controls in the cockpit of the future.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"inline-image-credit\\\"\\u003E(SpaceX)\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFew of the reporters swarming Musk were asking about the new space capsule, with its iPad-like control panel and 3D-printed engines. They wanted to know about SpaceX\\u0026#8217;s lawsuit against the Air Force, which had awarded an $11 billion contract to the United Launch Alliance without opening it up to other bids. Musk gives good quote; this was the summer of Russia\\u0026#8217;s buccaneering in eastern Ukraine, and he had been excoriating ULA for its reliance on Russian engines as relations deteriorated. Later in the summer, a judge ordered the Air Force and SpaceX into a mediation process that SpaceX executives hope will end with their receiving a share of the contract.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn September, NASA announced that it was awarding two contracts to carry astronauts to the space shuttle—$4.2 billion for Boeing and $2.6 billion for SpaceX. The startling discrepancy between the two contracts has yet to be convincingly explained, since NASA says both are for the exact same set of tasks. Boeing representatives say it likely reflects their greater reliability, a subtle dig at what they see as an immature space vehicle—even though by now the Falcon 9 has had 13 launches with not one failure. According to leaked documents, NASA officials said that SpaceX is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://aviationweek.com/space/why-nasa-rejected-sierra-nevadas-commercial-crew-vehicle\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eahead of schedule\\u003C/a\\u003E compared to Boeing, but the NASA official grading the suitability of the two proposals had Boeing\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/why-boeing-beat-spacex-in-nasas-space-taxi-contest-1412207046\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003E edging out SpaceX by 6%\\u003C/a\\u003E—roughly the difference between \\u0026#8220;excellent\\u0026#8221; and \\u0026#8220;very good.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut given that Boeing\\u0026#8217;s proposal costs 62% more, it seems clear that the veteran firm will be under pressure to trim the fat, just as ULA has embarked on a radical cost-cutting project and a partnership with Blue Origin—a space company founded by Amazon\\u0026#8217;s Jeff Bezos, which is another target of Musk\\u0026#8217;s public skepticism. Congressional appropriators are already questioning the cost of supporting two commercial crew programs and of NASA\\u0026#8217;s own scaled-back manned exploration project, Orion, which replaced Constellation in 2011. A third firm that competed for the job and lost, Sierra Nevada Corporation, has formally challenged NASA\\u0026#8217;s decision specifically on the basis of Boeing\\u0026#8217;s added cost.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003ETo boldly go\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWith 33 commercial launches on its manifest in the next four years, a plan to launch manned missions by 2017, and subsidies from Texas to build its own spaceport there after several years of leasing government facilities, SpaceX is now a serious competitor in the launch industry. That\\u0026#8217;s a validation for NASA\\u0026#8217;s public-private partnership, which was focused on developing a business, not a product.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut the question for Musk and his investors now is whether he can be more than just a better rocket builder. They want to unlock something far more challenging: A space economy where humans can vastly increase their productivity in the vacuum around our tiny world and beyond, even if nobody is quite sure how yet. Nolan of Founders Fund compares this hopeful uncertainty to the founding of the internet. \\u0026#8220;It wasn\\u0026#8217;t clear exactly what kind of business can come out of exchanging information really rapidly,\\u0026#8221; he says.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor example, if it weren\\u0026#8217;t so pricey, investors could imagine putting up hundreds of new satellites in lower orbits than existing ones, making their communications and imaging far more powerful. Because of the high launch costs, current satellites aren\\u0026#8217;t upgraded frequently and are stationed relatively far from earth so that they can last longer—the closer a satellite flies to earth, the faster its orbit decays, leading to its eventual demise. As a result, the electronics in them are relatively old technology.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003ECan the $6 million launch—or even cheaper—replace the $60 million launch?\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECheap enough launches could also enable terrestrial flights that hop up over the atmosphere, turning a day-long flight around the world into a matter of hours. Space tourism is often cited as a possible source of revenue, as is commercial research, even asteroid mining, but making any of those sustainable will mean—you guessed it—far lower costs, as NASA has found in its \\u003Ca title=\\\"How patent law and the dysfunctional US congress is killing private space research\\\" href=\\\"http://qz.com/267996/how-patent-law-and-the-dysfunctional-us-congress-is-killing-private-space-research/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Efailure to drum up much commercial research\\u003C/a\\u003E at the ISS.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECan the $6 million launch—or even cheaper—replace the $60 million launch? The way to solve that is to stop throwing rockets away after one use; after all, they cost about as much as a 737. Make them reusable and the cost savings are enormous: SpaceX says that while the rocket costs $54 million, the fuel only costs $200,000.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHence the company\\u0026#8217;s focus first on the Grasshopper, a scale model of a Falcon 9 that experimented with vertical takeoff and landing. Now, nearly every SpaceX satellite launch uses a rocket equipped with those massive landing legs we mentioned earlier, and the company attempts to \\u0026#8220;land\\u0026#8221; the rocket in the ocean. So far, there hasn\\u0026#8217;t been a success, but company insiders say the data they are gathering is bringing them closer and closer to bringing the huge tube from super-sonic speed to a delicate touch-down. That would be the killer app.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'\\u003E\\u003Ciframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/uIlu7szab5I?version=3\\u0026#038;rel=1\\u0026#038;fs=1\\u0026#038;showsearch=0\\u0026#038;showinfo=1\\u0026#038;iv_load_policy=1\\u0026#038;start=17\\u0026#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'\\u003E\\u003C/iframe\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe twin risks of sclerosis and megalomania\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut some observers fear SpaceX is becoming less nimble, losing the advantages it had over the big military-industrial contractors. Musk can no longer interview every employee now that the staff numbers in the thousands. Yes, standards remain high: Almost 400 workers \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spacex-employees-lawsuit-20140811-story.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ewere fired this summer\\u003C/a\\u003E after winding up at the bottom of a performance review, prompting a lawsuit. Nonetheless, towards the end of his time working with SpaceX, Horkachuck fretted that the company itself was starting to behave more and more like the traditional contractors it disdained. Meanwhile, Marty, NASA\\u0026#8217;s former in-house venture capitalist, fears that the agency is already losing its brief focus on disruption and commercialization to build another large bureaucracy around the commercial crew program.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd then there are the distractions of financing and dealing with investors, which get more complex as the sums increase. SpaceX was reportedly exploring another fundraising round earlier this year that could have valued it at $10 billion, but no deal has materialized. The company recently retained Abernathy MacGregor, a corporate public-relations firm specializing in investor relations and M\\u0026amp;A.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMusk is reportedly not done yet. Everyone around him speaks of his single-minded devotion to the company, despite being the CEO of Tesla and chairman of Solar City, and of his single-minded focus on the fantastic long-term goal—Mars. Not long after SpaceX won its first $1.6 billion contract from NASA, he surprised some of the directors during a meeting at the company\\u0026#8217;s rocket-testing facility in Texas by mentioning, in an aside, that the designs for the Martian vessel were nearly complete. In 2009, he promised tourist trips around the moon by 2014.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhile a CEO obsessed with going to Mars might be seen as a detriment, SpaceX\\u0026#8217;s backers say it protects the company\\u0026#8217;s culture—and helps its near-term goals. It\\u0026#8217;s no accident that the data gleaned from rocket-landing experiments \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://m.aviationweek.com/space/nasa-spacex-share-data-supersonic-retropropulsion\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eis also of interest\\u003C/a\\u003E to scientists thinking about landing cargo on Mars.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, however, the next milestone is a more modest one: To prove that human passengers will be safe in Dragon 2. First, there will be a pad abort test, to prove that if something goes wrong with the rocket before launch, the space capsule can detach, using its own thrusters to fly the crew to safety. If that goes as planned, there will be an in-flight test of the same ability to act as a lifeboat if the rocket breaks up before reaching orbit. These safety measures are a reminder that there will come a point when SpaceX\\u0026#8217;s rockets could be destroyed while carrying real space engineers, not just the ashes of an actor who pretended to be one.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERockets are tricky, as Musk says. But this is a man who thinks he\\u0026#8217;ll own a Martian colony with perhaps thousands of people in 2040, in time for his 70th birthday. You can trust he\\u0026#8217;ll get you to a space station just 205 miles up, right?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EEditor\\u0026#8217;s note: We\\u0026#8217;re grateful for the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/oral_histories.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eoral history project\\u003C/a\\u003E at NASA\\u0026#8217;s Johnson Space Center, which provided much useful background material and several quotes for this article. \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-282407\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-large\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"inline-image-tools\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" class=\\\"share-button\\\" data-image-id=\\\"282407\\\"\\u003EShare\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n\\t\\t\\t\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"share-icons desaturated\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F281619%2Fwhat-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company%2Fi%2F282407%2F\\u0026text=What+it+took+for+Elon+Musk%26%238217%3Bs+SpaceX+to+disrupt+Boeing%2C+leapfrog+NASA%2C+and+become+a+serious+space+company\\u0026via=qz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F281619%2Fwhat-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company%2Fi%2F282407%2F\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"help-text\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-zoom\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003ETap image to zoom\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/spacex-goodnight.jpg?w=1024\\\" data-retina=\\\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/spacex-goodnight.jpg?w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"inline-image-credit\\\"\\u003E(SpaceX)\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=281619\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/281619/what-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-10-21T06:00:26-04:00\",\"category\":\"Space Business\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=281619\",\"dc_creator\":\"Tim Fernholz\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/tankland.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"tankland\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/tankland.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/281619/what-it-took-for-elon-musks-spacex-to-disrupt-boeing-leapfrog-nasa-and-become-a-serious-space-company/"], ["published_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 10:00:26 UTC +00:00], ["title", "What it took for Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX to disrupt Boeing, leapfrog NASA, and become a serious space company"], ["updated_at", Tue, 21 Oct 2014 13:00:35 UTC +00:00]]
